class KnapsackProblem(DynamicProgrammingProblem):
    """
    Class for solving the Knapsack problem using dynamic programming.

    Knapsack problem is an optimization problem. It can be described the
    next way. You have a set of items, each with a weight and a value, and you
    have a knapsack with a maximum weight capacity. The goal is to determine
    the combination of items to include in the knapsack that maximizes the
    total value while not exceeding the weight capacity.
    Dynamic programming offers an option to solve this problem within O(n*w)
    time where n - amount of items, w - knapsack capacity. Since this is
    well-known NP-hard problem, usual time to solve is O(2**n).

        Solves the Maximum Subarray Sum problem for each query in an
        optimized manner using Mo's algorithm.

        The time complexity of this method is O(Q * sqrt(N)) for Q queries,
        where N is the length of the input array.
        This is because, in the worst case, each query requires
        O(sqrt(N)) operations to adjust the pointers.
        The space complexity of this method is O(1),
        since it requires nothing, but 4 pointers and 2 variables for
        storing sums.
