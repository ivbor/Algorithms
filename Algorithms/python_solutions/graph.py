    Represents a graph structure with basic functionality, as well as advanced
    methods to manipulate and analyze the graph properties.

        Time complexity: O((V + E) * log V)

        Time complexity comes from the following facts:
            - while acts as for cycle going through all vertices making
            while-for section O(V + E);
            - additional heappush operation within while-for performs in
            log V time.

        the shortest paths from the source in terms of the number of edges.
        Then, it attempts to find blocking flows in this level graph

        """
        Method implementing the Goldberg-Tarjan's algorithm
        to find the maximum flow from a source to a sink in a flow network.

        This method uses the preflow-push (or push-relabel) approach,
        which initializes a preflow that exceeds the flow demands
        and then adjusts to find the max flow by moving excess flow
        from the source towards the sink via allowable paths,
        modifying vertex heights and relabeling vertices as necessary
        to maintain feasibility.
        The function repeatedly processes active vertices
        (those with excess flow and not equal to the source or sink)
        by trying to push this excess flow towards the sink.
        If no flow can be pushed, the function relabels the vertex
        (increases its height) to create new allowable paths
