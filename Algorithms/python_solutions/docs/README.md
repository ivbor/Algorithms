## Here will be beautiful documentation

I decided not to use html due to Github not being able to render it as is,
and because I do not want to use my Github Pages for this.

Hence, my choice is markdown or pdf. Since my computer for unknown reason has
a problem with .tex files, and markdown is basically a plain text - 
I will use markdown for this purpose.

Currently I tried Sphinx, Pydoc-markdown and numpydoc. While neither of them
satisfied me, I took some stuff from their source code and will try to 
develop a decent markdown style and parser myself because it is just making
plain text from plain text.
